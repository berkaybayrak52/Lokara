# 04 — App/API structure and delivery status

This is the canonical contract for Lokara's tracked app structure, route compatibility and delivery
status. German UI copy, feature-based organization and WCAG 2.1 AA/BFSG requirements apply to the
web app and the future mobile app. The reviewed 108-line predecessor remains available with
`git show 635acf9:docs/04-web-app-structure.md`; no separate history file is needed.

## Status model

| Status                    | Meaning                                                                                |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Shipped**               | Present on `main`; this is the current repository or runtime contract.                 |
| **Prepared but unmerged** | Implemented and verified on a named branch, but absent from `main`.                    |
| **Specified**             | The behavior is documented, but its production implementation is incomplete or absent. |
| **Future**                | Selected direction for a later milestone; not a current workspace or capability.       |

## Shipped repository structure

```text
lokara/
├─ apps/
│  ├─ api/                    # Python FastAPI modular monolith
│  └─ web/                    # Next.js App Router client; HTTP API only
├─ packages/
│  ├─ domain/                 # normalized value objects and pure shared primitives
│  ├─ nk-engine/              # pure Python NK allocation
│  ├─ heating-engine/         # pure Python heating/CO₂ calculation
│  ├─ rules-store/            # versioned rule data resolved by callers
│  ├─ adapters/               # ports plus current stubs/adapters
│  ├─ db/                     # SQLAlchemy, Alembic and RLS
│  ├─ pdf/                    # HTML→PDF through Playwright Chromium
│  └─ ui/                     # shared TypeScript web components/tokens
├─ pyproject.toml             # explicit uv workspace members
├─ package.json               # Bun workspace: apps/web + packages/ui
└─ turbo.json
```

The uv workspace contains `apps/api` and every Python package shown above except `ui`. The Bun
workspace contains exactly `apps/web` and `packages/ui`.

`apps/mobile`, AfA/export/KPI engines, Redis and workers are absent. Real Supabase, Vision, bank,
email and MDL providers are also absent; current external edges use local infrastructure or stubs.
These are **Future**, not empty shipped modules.

### Binding dependency direction

- Engines depend only on normalized domain shapes.
- Engines import no FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, rules store or vendor SDK.
- The API resolves rules, loads normalized persistence data and calls engines/adapters.
- Web accesses data only through FastAPI and never imports the DB layer.
- TypeScript and Python workspaces meet at the HTTP/JSON contract.

## Shipped web route compatibility map

The page numbers below are compatibility anchors used by application and package source comments:
pages 1–6 preserve the M3 names and page 7 preserves the canned M4 flow. Do not renumber them when
navigation changes.

| Page | Name                   | Current route                                                      |
| ---: | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|    1 | Dashboard              | `/a/{accountId}`                                                   |
|    2 | Objekte                | `/a/{accountId}/objekte` and `/a/{accountId}/objekte/{buildingId}` |
|    3 | Einheit/Mietverhältnis | `/a/{accountId}/einheiten/{unitId}`                                |
|    4 | Kosten erfassen        | `/a/{accountId}/kosten`                                            |
|    5 | Zähler                 | `/a/{accountId}/zaehler`                                           |
|    6 | Abrechnung erstellen   | `/a/{accountId}/abrechnung`                                        |
|    7 | Beleg-Upload           | `/a/{accountId}/beleg`                                             |

`/styleguide` is a separate shipped design-token/stack showcase, not page 8. `/` resolves the
caller's visible relationship and enters the account portal; it is not one of the numbered pages.

## Shipped API surface

There is one FastAPI application. Its current route families are:

- `/health` and the environment-gated `/auth/dev-token`;
- token-context `/me`, `/demo/{load,reset,summary}` and `/calc/nk` routes;
- `/a/{accountId}` summary and fixed demo-statement/PDF routes;
- `/a/{accountId}` building, unit, tenancy, cost/allocation-key, meter/reading, heating-cost and
  extraction routes.

There is no shipped bootstrap API route. JSON uses camelCase at the client boundary and snake_case
inside Python; Pydantic validates the backend boundary.

## Shipped authentication — Auth in one api.ts interceptor

- JWT verification accepts the web's HttpOnly `lokara_access_token` cookie or a Bearer token through
  the same API dependency. Future mobile uses that Bearer path with secure storage.
- JWTs still require an `account_id` claim. For every `/a/{accountId}/…` route, authorization instead
  takes account context from the URL, verifies a live Membership for the caller and that account,
  and sets the transaction-local RLS context from the URL value.
- `/me`, `/demo/*` and `/calc/nk` remain token-context exceptions. `/me` can expose at most the one
  account selected by the token; listing all relationships and account switching are not shipped.
- Current authorization checks Membership existence and revocation only. It does not enforce
  `OWNER`, `EMPLOYEE` or `TAX_ADVISOR` behavior, and it does not enforce employee building
  assignments.
- The web client performs one single-flight refresh for concurrent 401 responses and replays each
  failed request once. A second 401 is returned; it does not loop.
- `ENVIRONMENT` is required. In `staging` and `production`, API startup refuses enabled dev-token
  minting, enabled demo seeding or the development secret published in `.env.example`.

Local login still uses the explicitly enabled dev-token route; no real Supabase Auth project is
wired. Demo load/reset also require their explicit flag and operate on the fixed demo account.

## Prepared but unmerged identity foundation

**Prepared but unmerged:** `app_bootstrap_contexts(text)` and migration `0006` exist only on
`slice/m5-bootstrap-contexts`, not on `main`. They define one bounded pre-context identity read; they
do not ship an account switcher, new dashboard or renter portal. `docs/02-data-model.md` owns the
detailed function, role, policy, privilege and call-site contract.

## Shipped statement boundary and Specified M6 work

The current statement route is the fixed 2025 **Vermieter-Gesamtübersicht**: a landlord-only,
building-wide calculation/QA preview. It is not a Mieter-Einzelabrechnung and must not be sent to a
renter. A period longer than 12 months hard-blocks before calculation or rendering.

Actual paid advances, Saldo, immutable/versioned finalization and separately constructed, isolated
tenant documents remain **Specified** for M6 in `docs/02` and `docs/08`; they are not shipped.

## Shipped Beleg-Upload boundary

`POST /a/{accountId}/buildings/{buildingId}/extractions` accepts PDF/PNG/JPG files up to 10 MB and
returns a proposal from the named stub provider. Extraction writes nothing server-side. The proposal
and review-form corrections are retained in account/building-scoped browser `localStorage`, so a
reload can restore the unfinished review.

Confirmation uses the ordinary cost-creation route and creates an ordinary `CostEntry` plus its
allocation-key assignment. No Beleg file, invoice date, vendor, archive record or hash is persisted.
The extracted category is only an editable free-text label; no cost type or allocation key is
inferred as law.

`docs/09-betrkv-catalogue.md` now **Specifies** the BetrKV catalogue. Production classification and
catalogue-backed default-key suggestions remain unimplemented.

## Future architecture

- M10 renter activation, `/renter/{tenancyId}`, renter-portal isolation and account-safe portal
  access are **Future**.
- `apps/mobile` is **Future** at M10: Expo/React Native, the same API verification through Bearer JWT,
  secure storage, TanStack Query, Jotai, React Hook Form/Zod, i18n and shared mobile
  theming/patterns. No shared mobile UI package exists today.
- Pure AfA/export/KPI packages wait for their approved specs and owning milestones.
- Redis plus Celery or Arq wait for a real rate-limit, retry, sync or scheduled-delivery slice.
- Real Supabase Auth/Storage/Postgres credentials and real Vision, bank, email and MDL providers wait
  for their integration and hosting/DPA decisions and stay behind adapters.

Named future choices are not installed dependencies or shipped capabilities.

## Binding UX invariants

- One primary action, explicit labels, calm 8px-based spacing and visible loading, error and empty
  states.
- **no data loss:** unfinished web forms use account-scoped browser drafts today; a successful submit
  clears the draft. Changing an allocation-key assignment appends history and does not delete the
  entered cost.
- Destructive mutations require clear intent. Legally immutable evidence appends or versions instead
  of overwriting.
- Keyboard access, visible focus, 200% zoom, contrast and reduced-motion requirements follow
  `docs/05-design-system.md`.
- Motion is CSS-based today. Framer Motion is selected but not installed; its first use must add and
  verify it explicitly.
